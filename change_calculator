/*I want to make a calulator that receives an amount in cents from the user and give 
 * back the amount of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies should be handed back.
 * I will first create variables. 
 * I will create a logical statement seeing if the amount is larger than a dollar and if not 
 * have it go through the same logic with quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
